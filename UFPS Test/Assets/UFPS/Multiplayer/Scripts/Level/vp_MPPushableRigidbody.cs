//	description:	put this script on a rigidbody or gameobject to allow a local
//					vp_FPController in multiplayer to push it around, or stand on
//					it to make it tilt etc. while syncing it authoritatively over
//					the network.
//
//					push detection is done client-side while keeping the master 
//					in charge of push force, proximity, direction, frequency and
//					rigidbody properties (mass, physics material etc.)
//
//					NOTES:
//					1) only use this script if you _really_ need the player to be
//						able to push an object around. for big and heavy objects
//						that the player should not be able to push (but should
//						still be movable by explosions, projectiles or scripting)
//						instead use the base script 'vp_MPRigidBody'
//					2) if you want the player to be able to ride the platform,
//						don't forget to put it in the 'MovableObject' layer (28),
//						otherwise the player will be prone to slide off
