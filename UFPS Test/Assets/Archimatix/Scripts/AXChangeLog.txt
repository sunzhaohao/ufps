Fixes:
Runtime: Fixed several runtime memory leaks.
Handle name textfield was initializing with text from the logic window.

Fixed a bug where custom nodes without an nodeicon were not displaying in the sidebar.
Fixed axis Orientation bug for combined meshes.
Thickened shapes had a missing face when the source shape was open.
Specific namespace calls to UnityEditor.Tools to avoid asset conflicts.
Control-delete deletes a word when editing a textfield instead of its node.
Empty relation expressions were throwing an error when copying and pasting.
Double-clicking a textfield in Grouper no longer closes it.
PlanRepeater: The end corner placement of an open plan are correctly oriented now.
ShapeMerger: clipping open shapes in DifferenceRail and IntersectionRail now works.


1.0.4
Features
Added zoom level display at t
he lower left corner of the node graph window.
Extruder now has a subdivision parameter called "Segs" in preperation for the upcoming Deformer nodes.
Relation Expressions may not be blank to make them uni-directional Relations.
The Enabled parameter is now relatable so that nodes can be turned on and off from a controller such as a Grouper.
Added zoom level display at the lower left corner of the node graph window.
New node: Channeler - takes mutliple mesh inuts and allows for a rule set to be entered into the logic field.
Added Parameter type String.
Advanced AX: Added an isEven(pName) function to Turtle Script
Advanced AX: Custom node classes (Subclasses of Generator) are now discoverable by Archiamtix. See: http://www.archimatix.com/manual/creating-custom-nodes

Fixed 
Middle points in FreeCurve are working again. And in Unity 5.5.
Finished namespace encapsulating 3rd-party libraries to avoid conflicts with other assets.
Setting the default material for a model caused it to disappear temerarily from the Scene View.
Boolean relation connections were not being displayed.
Turtle Scripting: sin and cos functions in turtle scripting
Turtle Scripting: modulo function is now working in tutle script
Turtle Scripting: Logic Refresh button works
Turtle Scripting: Logic window no longer loses focus unexpectedly
Turtle Scripting: Fixed a bug with the turtle script loop

1.0.3
Features
Reversed the top edge Extrude handle behavior. By default the handle controls bevel radius and while holding the alt/option key down controls taper.
Added Node Graph zooming with RMB in addition to scrollwheel.
FlipX now works for shape parameters.
Parameter number fields now expand with the node windows.
Beta version of a new node called Lander, which stamps a building footprint in a Unity Terrain.

Fixes
Copy and paste bug in logic text area, expression fields and float fields.
Wandering node graph camera has been fixed.
Instancing a Grouper while it is open no longer causes a cycle.
Removed references to depricated Handle calls which threw warnings in Unity 5.6.
An un-handled GUI.Label state was causing the Unity ColorPicker and other GUI items to have bad label widths.
Scene handles no longer are super-scaled when Parametric Object is scaled.
Wrapped 3rd-party ibraries in custom namespaces to avoid conflicts with other assets.
Deleteing a Shape node and then clicking on ShapeMerger in the node menu created a dangling connector to the location of the deleted node.

1.0.2
Fixes
A UnityEditor calls in core runtime files were causing an error on project build.
Middle mouse button no longer selects AX objects.
Long scene save times fixed. No delay on save scene. Saving a library item is also faster now.
Fixed Material inheritance bug where, if a node had a downstream node connected, it would not update a material change.

1.0.1
Features
Added a Physics foldout to the MaterialTool node so that that node could specify a PhysicMaterial and a "density." The density is used to set the mass of any mesh created based on the meshe's volume.
New Node: Physics Joiner - groups input nodes together physically using FixedJoints, essentially making a concave mesh collider.
New Turtle script command: closed true/false
Added a checkbox for Mesh Renderer to the Inspector so that generated object can act as a collider only.
BETA NODE: Terrain Deformer
Added Terrain input fields to PlanRepeater

Fixes
After editing a parameter field using keystrokes, clicking on the scene view window would temporarily hide the model.
When when clicking on the new MaterialTool node button on the node palette, the texture was not responding to the controls until after a scene save.
When a MaterialTool was deleted, the the parametric object was no longer inheriting texture control values from downstream.
PrefabInstancer can now works in PlanRepeater.
Error thrown in some cases when deleting a light from the scene.
Can now make a Prefab with an AXModel that features a PrefabInstancer (thanks to Enoch)
Adjusted Personal Skin colors to accentuate selection highlights.
Fixed recent bug with errors cast when opening Transforms foldout on any node.
Reinstated pan and zoom animation in the Node Graph Editor window
New nodes appear in more predictable places
Cut and paste distinguishes between text in fields and copy/pasting nodes themselves.
Introduced a delay in KeyUp builds  in number fields that were causing slow downs when entering several numbers.
